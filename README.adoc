An Arduino stack based fixed string class:


```cpp

#include <FixedString.h>

Replace:

char buffer[24];
strcpy(buffer,"This is my");
strcat(buffer," string");
Serial.println(buffer);


With:

FixedString<24> buffer="This is my";
buffer+=" string";
Serial.println(buffer.c_str());


OR if the maximum string size used is a known:

Replace:

String s;
s+="Some stuff";
s+="some other stuff";
s+=2300;
Serial.println(s.c_str());


With:

FixedString<48> s;
s+="Some stuff";
s+="some other stuff";
s+=2300;
Serial.println(s.c_str());

OR where formatting needed:

FixedString<64> s;
s.format("Testing format: int: %i, long: %li", 10, 75000l);
Serial.println(s.c_str());

s.format(F("Testing flash format: int: %i, long: %li"), 10, 75000l);
Serial.println(s.c_str());


```
